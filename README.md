This project contains a Colab notebook implementing an **Image Classification** model using Python.  
It demonstrates how to preprocess image data, train a model, and classify images into different categories.

## Files

- `image_classification.ipynb` – Notebook with the implementation of the image classification model
- `data/` – Folder containing image datasets used in the project

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Make sure the image datasets are in the `data/` folder.  
3. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the images, train the model, and classify new images.
